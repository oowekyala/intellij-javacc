<p>What's new:

<ul>
    <li>JJTree and JavaCC grammars now are more clearly cut. Before this release, *.jjt and *.jj
        files were both treated as JJTree grammars (because JJTree is a clean superset of JavaCC),
        and features of JJTree insight were always available. For reasons of code organisation and
        to enable better error reporting, the JJTree features are now only enabled in *.jjt files,
        usage in *.jj files raise an error and a suggestion to rename the file. You can configure
        different file patterns in <b>Settings | Editor | File Types</b>.
    </li>
    <li>A bunch of features:
        <ul>
            <li>Links to the grammar for a JJTree node from their corresponding Java node class
                if it can be found in the project.</li>
            <li>Link from the parser file to the grammar.</li>
            <li>Completion suggestions for regex productions, options, and lexical states</li>
            <li>Options are now documented.</li>
            <li>Prettier icons, based on a JavaCC logo and following the IntelliJ UI guidelines</li>
            <li>Folding of code generated by JJTree in .jj files (@bgen sections)</li>
            <li>Find usages, completion, and summary documentation for lexical states</li>
            <li>Implicit tokens now also have a link in the documentation of BNF expansions</li>
            <li>Some performance optimisations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>What's fixed:
<ul>
    <li>Parser tolerance to incomplete code has been significantly improved. Starting to type a new production should
        now never break the rest of the grammar</li>
    <li>Completion result insertion making a mess when the tail characters are already present</li>
    <li>Unnecessary parentheses inspection wasn't initialised correctly</li>
    <li>Rename refactoring was broken since 1.1. There are still some things to do to make it smarter.</li>
</ul>
