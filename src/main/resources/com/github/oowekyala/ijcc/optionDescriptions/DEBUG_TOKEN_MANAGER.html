This option is used to obtain debugging information from the
generated token manager. Setting this option to true causes the
token manager to generate a trace of its actions. This trace is rather large
and should only be used when you have a lexical error that has
been reported to you and you cannot understand why. Typically,
in this situation, you can determine the problem by looking at
the last few lines of this trace.
