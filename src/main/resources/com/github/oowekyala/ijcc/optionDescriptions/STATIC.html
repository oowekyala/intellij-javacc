If true, all methods and class variables are specified as static in the
generated parser and token manager. This allows only one parser
object to be present, but it improves the performance of the
parser. To perform multiple parses during one run of your Java
program, you will have to call the <code>ReInit()</code> method to reinitialize
your parser if it is static. If the parser is non-static, you
may use the "new" operator to construct as many parsers as you
wish. These can all be used simultaneously from different threads.
