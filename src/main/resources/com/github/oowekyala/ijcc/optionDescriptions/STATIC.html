            If true, all methods and class variables are specified as static in the
            generated parser and token manager. This allows only one parser
            object to be present, but it improves the performance of the
            parser. To perform multiple parses during one run of your Java
            program, you will have to call the <code>ReInit()</code> method to reinitialize
            your parser if it is static. If the parser is non-static, you
            may use the "new" operator to construct as many parsers as you
            wish. These can all be used simultaneously from different threads.

            Generate code for a static parser. The default for this is true.
            This must be used consistently with the equivalent JavaCC options.
            The value of this option is emitted in the JavaCC source.
