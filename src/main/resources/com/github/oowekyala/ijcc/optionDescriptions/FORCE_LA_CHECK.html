This option setting controls lookahead ambiguity checking performed by JavaCC.
By default (when this option is false), lookahead ambiguity checking
is performed for all choice points where the default lookahead
of 1 is used. Lookahead ambiguity checking is not performed at
choice points where there is an explicit lookahead specification,
or if the option {option_link LOOKAHEAD} is set to something other than 1.
Setting this option to true performs lookahead ambiguity checking
at all choice points regardless of the lookahead specifications
in the grammar file.
