This option is used to obtain debugging information from the generated parser.
Setting this option to true causes the parser to generate a trace
of its actions. Tracing may be disabled by calling the method
<code>disable_tracing()</code> in the generated parser class. Tracing may
be subsequently enabled by calling the method <code>enable_tracing()</code>
in the generated parser class.
