By default JavaCC generates a character stream reader as specified
by the options JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE and UNICODE_INPUT. The generated
token manager receives characters from this stream reader. If
this option is set to true, then the token manager is generated
to read characters from any character stream reader of type "CharStream.java".
That file is generated into the generated parser directory.

<p>This option is ignored if {option_link USER_TOKEN_MANAGER} is set to true.
