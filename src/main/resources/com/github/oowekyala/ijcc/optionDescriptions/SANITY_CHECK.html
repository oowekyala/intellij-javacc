Set this option to false to disable some semantic checks when building.
JavaCC performs many syntactic and semantic checks on the grammar file
during parser generation. Some checks such as detection of left
recursion, detection of ambiguity, and bad usage of empty expansions
may be suppressed for faster parser generation. Note that the presence of these errors (even
if they are not detected and reported by setting this option
to false) can cause unexpected behavior from the generated parser
