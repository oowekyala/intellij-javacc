This is the number of tokens considered in checking choices
of the form <code>A | B | ...</code> for ambiguity.

<p>For example, if there is a common two token prefix for both <code>A</code>
    and <code>B</code>, but no common three token prefix, (assume this option
    is set to 3) then JavaCC can tell you to use a lookahead of 3 for disambiguation
    purposes. And if A and B have a common three token prefix, then JavaCC only
    tell you that you need to have a lookahead of 3 or more. Increasing this can
    give you more comprehensive ambiguity information at the cost of more processing
    time. For large grammars such as the Java grammar, increasing this number any
    further causes the checking to take too much time.
