Setting this option to true causes the generated parser to lookahead
for extra tokens ahead of time. This facilitates some performance
improvements. However, in this case (when the option is true),
interactive applications may not work since the parser needs
to work synchronously with the availability of tokens from the
input stream. In such cases, it's best to leave this option at
its default value.
