Setting this option to true causes the generated token manager to ignore
case in the token specifications and the input files. This is
useful for writing grammars for languages such as HTML. It is
also possible to localize the effect of IGNORE_CASE by adding
the <code>[IGNORE_CASE]</code> annotation on regex productions.
