Specify a class containing a factory method with following signature to construct nodes:
<pre>
     public static Node jjtCreate(int id)
</pre>

<p>For backwards compatibility, the value true may also be specified,
    meaning that the node class will be used as the factory class, for
    each node. This is equivalent to using the string <code>"*"</code>
    as a value.

<p>If the value is an empty string (or default), the constructor of the
    node class will be used instead.
