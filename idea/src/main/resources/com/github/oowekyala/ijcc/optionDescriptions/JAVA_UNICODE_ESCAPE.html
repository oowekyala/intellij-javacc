When set to true, the generated parser uses an input stream object that
processes Java Unicode escapes (\u...) before sending characters
to the token manager. By default, Java Unicode escapes are not
processed.

<p>This option is ignored if either of options {option_link USER_TOKEN_MANAGER},
{option_link USER_CHAR_STREAM} is set to true.
