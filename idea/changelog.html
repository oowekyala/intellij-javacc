<p>What's new:

<ul>
    <li>Start sets of productions are now available in the quickdoc, to
        help you optimise your lookaheads.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>What's changed:
<ul>
    <li>TODO</li>
</ul>

<p>What's fixed:
<ul>
    <li>Tokens like <code>"<"</code> being invisible in the quick documentation
        because no HTML escape was performed.
    </li>
    <li>Parentheses between two scoped expansion units are not unnecessary, eg
    <code> ( "foo" #Foo ) #Bar</code></li>
    <li>Some empty parser actions blocks are not unnecessary, specifically when
        they occur as the last expansion of a JJTree node scope and are preceded
        by another parser actions unit. This is because JJTree inserts the code
        for closing the node <i>before</i> the last parser action, so eg the node
        condition can't be affected anymore in the last unit.
    </li>
</ul>
