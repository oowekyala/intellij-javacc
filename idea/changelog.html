<p>What's new:

<ul>
    <li>FIRST sets of productions are now available in the quickdoc, to
        help you optimise your lookaheads. There are two new sections in the
        doc:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Condensed FIRST set:</b> This is a set of tokens and productions
                that is equivalent to the full FIRST set below. If some productions
                in the FIRST set may yield at most one token, then they are not expanded.
                So if you have a production A := "b" | "c" in the FIRST set, instead of
                having "b" and "c" in the resulting set, you have A. This can dramatically
                shorten this section for big grammars.
                <b>FIRST set:</b> This is the fully expanded set of tokens. Note that
                JAVACODE productions are included there since we can't break them down.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>What's changed:

    <li>TODO</li>
</ul>

<p>What's fixed:
<ul>
    <li>Tokens like <code>"<"</code> being invisible in the quick documentation
        because no HTML escaping was performed.
    </li>
    <li>Parentheses between two scoped expansion units are not unnecessary, eg
    <code> ( "foo" #Foo ) #Bar</code></li>
    <li>Some empty parser actions blocks are not unnecessary, specifically when
        they occur as the last expansion of a JJTree node scope and are preceded
        by another parser actions unit. This is because JJTree inserts the code
        for closing the node <i>before</i> the last parser action, so eg the node
        condition can't be affected anymore in the last unit.
    </li>
    <li>Similarly, some consecutive parser actions blocks can't be merged.</li>
</ul>
